# Roll-A-Ball

In this repository you will find a sample app [Roll-a-ball] (https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball),
 with some modifications.


# Getting Started

[Unity UI starter kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/unity-samples-ui-25468)

The project has several scripts, both to record points when collecting coins, to reset the player at the beginning of the level if he falls or is touched by an enemy... A menu screen with player movement and at the end of the last level (2 ) a text will appear saying that you have won and two buttons to play again or to exit it.
